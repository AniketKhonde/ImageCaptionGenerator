Image Caption Generator
This project is an implementation of an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of images and their corresponding captions to generate captions for new images.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pillow
Matplotlib
You can install all the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Dataset
The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which consists of 8,000 images each with 5 captions. You can download the dataset from here.

Usage
Download the Flickr8k dataset and extract it to the data directory.
Preprocess the data by running python preprocess.py. This will generate the necessary data files for training.
Train the model by running python train.py. You can modify the hyperparameters in the config.py file to experiment with different configurations.
Generate captions for new images by running python generate.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg. This will display the generated caption for the image.
Model
The image caption generator is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts features from the image and the decoder is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that generates the caption word by word.

The pre-trained CNN used in this project is the InceptionV3 model trained on the ImageNet dataset.

The RNN decoder consists of a single-layer LSTM with 256 hidden units.

Results
The model achieves a BLEU-4 score of around 0.3 on the test set, which is a reasonable performance for this task.

Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the paper "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator" by Vinyals et al.

The code for the preprocessing and model architecture is based on the TensorFlow tutorial on image captioning.

The Flickr8k dataset is created by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
