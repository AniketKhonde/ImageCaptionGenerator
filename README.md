**Image Caption Generator**
Overview
This project aims to automatically generate captions for images using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for sequence generation, the system generates contextually relevant descriptions for input images.



**Requirements**
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV



**Installation**
**  I assumed that the user has their own images to use with the image caption generator. If the user does not have their own image dataset, they would need to obtain images from a source such as an image dataset repository or through web scraping. It's important to ensure that the usage of any downloaded images complies with copyright and licensing requirements.**

Clone this repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/AnketKhonde/ImageCaptionGenerator.git



**Install the required dependencies:**

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt



**Usage**
Ensure that you have trained or downloaded pre-trained models for both image feature extraction and caption generation.

Run the main script:

css

Copy code

python generate_caption.py --image_path path_to_your_image.jpg
